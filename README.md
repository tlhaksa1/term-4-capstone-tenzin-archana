# Capstone project
## Team members: Tenzin Lhaksampa & Archana Balan

You should hand in the code for a data web app that you create based on an application of your interest. 

The project includes a 5 minute (maximum) video and one page (maximum) markdown readme file describing your project. Your MD readme file should include a link to the video that I can see or the video included in the repo. 

You name should be on your readme file, in the project video and in all code files as comments. 

The project due date is extremely firm for graduating seniors. 

## Grading rubric

The project must involve data, analysis – it can be prediction, regression, whatever, it has to involve data at some level (project will be rejected if this condition is failed to be met)  

There must be a streamlit app (the project will be rejected if this condition is not met) 

Each team must submit a write up in the form of your readme file, and a 5 minute video (the project will be rejected if this condition is not met). 

Then the project will be graded on: 

Is the app documented with instructions on use  

Effort, points will be deducted for low effort projects (like a simple BMI calculator or something like that) 

Correctness of results – was the data treated appropriately, was it cleaned appropriately, are there large conceptual or practical errors 

Communication – was the app well presented, do I have a sense of what it’s doing, is the web site and readme well presented?
